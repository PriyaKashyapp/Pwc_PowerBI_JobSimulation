# Introduction

Welcome to my submission for the PwC Power BI Job Simulation. This task focuses on the importance of digital upskilling, the role of a Digital Accelerator, and developing Power BI dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.

## Task 1: Customer Retention Analysis Dashboard for Call Center Data
### Power BI dashboard to visualize customer retention KPIs and provide strategic insights for improving retention rates.

## Key Findings:
### Churn Rate: The overall customer churn rate is 9.65%, with a significant proportion of customers on month-to-month contracts leaving.
### Service Usage: Internet and phone services are the most subscribed, with 27% of customers opting for phone services.
### Payment Behavior: Customers using electronic checks show a higher churn rate, suggesting dissatisfaction with this payment method.
### Demographic Trends: Gender-based churn rates are similar, but female customers with dependents show a slightly higher likelihood of leaving.


## Recommendations:
### Reduce Churn for Month-to-Month Customers: Offer targeted discounts or service upgrades to retain customers on flexible contracts.
### Improve Payment Experience: Investigate concerns around electronic payments and provide additional secure payment options.
### Promote Value-Added Services: Increase engagement with underutilized services like streaming TV and movies through marketing efforts.
### Personalized Retention Strategies: Implement AI-driven churn prediction models to proactively identify and address at-risk customers.


## Task 2: Customer Risk and Churn Analysis Dashboard for Customer Data.
### The Customer Risk and Churn Analysis dashboard provides key insights into customer attrition patterns, service subscription behaviors, and demographic influences on churn. The analysis identifies critical factors contributing to customer churn and suggests strategic actions to mitigate risks.

## Key Findings:
### Churn Rate: The overall churn rate stands at 9.65%, with the highest attrition observed among customers on month-to-month contracts and those facing higher monthly charges.
### Service Subscription Trends: Internet and phone services are the most subscribed, with 27% of customers opting for phone services.
### Customer Account Patterns: Electronic check users show a disproportionately high churn rate, suggesting potential dissatisfaction with this payment method.
### Demographic Insights: While churn rates remain consistent across genders, female customers with dependents exhibit a slightly higher likelihood of leaving.

## Recommendations:
### Enhance Retention Strategies: Implement targeted incentives such as discounted rates or service upgrades for month-to-month subscribers.
### Improve Service Adoption: Boost engagement with underutilized services (e.g., streaming TV and movies) through tailored marketing campaigns.


## Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion Analysis for HR Data.
### Create visualizations that represent HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and analyze the root causes behind the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level.

## Key Findings:
### Gender Representation: The workforce is nearly balanced, but women are underrepresented in senior leadership roles.
### Ethnic Diversity: Some ethnic groups are significantly underrepresented, particularly in mid-to-senior level positions.
### Pay Equity: The analysis reveals a gender pay gap, with women earning slightly less than their male counterparts for similar roles.
### Employee Satisfaction: Employees from underrepresented groups report lower job satisfaction and engagement levels, which may contribute to higher turnover rates.
### Recruitment Trends: Hiring patterns indicate fewer diverse candidates being shortlisted for key roles, highlighting potential biases in recruitment.

## Recommendations:
### Promote Leadership Diversity: Implement mentorship programs and leadership development initiatives for underrepresented groups.
### Enhance Pay Transparency: Conduct regular pay equity audits and establish clear salary bands to ensure fairness.
### Improve Employee Engagement: Introduce inclusive policies, such as flexible working arrangements and employee resource groups, to boost satisfaction.
### Bias-Free Hiring Practices: Use structured interviews and diverse hiring panels to reduce unconscious bias.
### Continuous Monitoring: Regularly track diversity metrics and employee feedback to assess progress and adjust strategies accordingly.

## Tools & Technologies Used
1) Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
2) DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced calculations.
3) Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query.

## Conclusion
These tasks enhanced my Power BI skills while providing valuable experience in analyzing business data, customer retention, and HR diversity metrics. Each dashboard presents key insights, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
