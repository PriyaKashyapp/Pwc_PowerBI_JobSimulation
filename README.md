# Introduction

Welcome to my submission for the PwC Power BI Job Simulation. This task focuses on the importance of digital upskilling, the role of a Digital Accelerator, and developing Power BI dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.

## Task 1: Customer Retention Analysis Dashboard for Call Center Data

### Objective: Analyzing customer churn to identify factors contributing to customer attrition.
### Key Metrics:

● Churn rate
● Customer demographics (age, region, etc.)
● Subscription type and tenure
● Service usage patterns

### Insights:


● Identifies high-risk customer segments for proactive retention strategies.
● Highlights service issues or pricing concerns leading to churn.
● Suggest predictive models to anticipate churn before it happens.

## Task 2: Customer Risk and Churn Analysis Dashboard for Customer Data.

### Objective: Evaluating call center performance and efficiency and provides key insights into customer attrition patterns, service subscription behaviors, and demographic influences on churn. The analysis identifies critical factors contributing to customer churn and suggests strategic actions to mitigate risks.

### Key Metrics:
● Average call duration
● First call resolution rate
● Customer satisfaction score
● Agent performance

### Insights:
● Highlights bottlenecks in customer service workflows.
● Identifies peak call times for better resource allocation.
● Measures agent effectiveness and training needs.

## Task 3: Diversity & Inclusion Analysis for HR Data.
### Objective: Assessing workplace diversity and inclusion efforts that represent HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs, and analyze the root causes behind the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level.

### Key Metrics:
● Employee demographics (gender, ethnicity, age, etc.)
● Representation across job levels
● Hiring and promotion trends

### Insights:
● Tracks progress toward DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) goals.
● Identifies disparities in hiring and promotions.
● Helps in creating targeted policies for an inclusive workplace
